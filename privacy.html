      <div class="about-content">
        <p>At Hannah Studios, I believe that your data belongs to you. This privacy policy applies to all iOS
          applications released by Hannah Studios, including Pan65, Slideshow Classic, Book Progress, and BauCulator.
        </p>
        <p>Each app also has its own specific privacy policy that can be accessed directly within the app’s settings and
          on its official Apple App Store page.</p>

        <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
        <p><strong>I do not collect, store, or share your personal data.</strong></p>
        <p>My apps are designed to function locally on your device. Any photos, documents, or data you create within the
          apps remain on your device or in your personal iCloud account (if applicable). I do not have access to any of
          this information.</p>

        <h3>2. Analytics</h3>
        <p>To respect your privacy, my apps do not use third-party analytics services that track your behavior across
          apps and websites. Apple may provide aggregated, anonymous crash reports and usage statistics if you have
          opted in to share analytics with App Developers in your device settings.</p>

        <h3>3. Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>Some apps may use Apple’s built-in frameworks (like CloudKit) to sync your data between your devices. This
          data is handled by Apple under their privacy policy and is not accessible by Hannah Studios.</p>

        <h3>4. Contact</h3>
        <p>If you have any specific questions about this privacy policy, please contact me at: <a
